Docker image derived from Alpine Linux that includes [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss). Enables building Hugo-based static sites that may include [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/) as part of the workflow. Usable with Bitbucket Pipelines, Gitlab CI, and other automated deployment tools that support Docker.

This image was made specifically for use on a particular type of project. It's meant to enable the use of Hugo Pipes and Sass.
